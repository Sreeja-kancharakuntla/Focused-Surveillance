# Focused-Surveillance
This project uses real-time video processing to enhance privacy by blurring all detected faces except the one closest to the center of the frame. Leveraging OpenCV and Haar cascade classifiers, it dynamically detects multiple faces, computes their distance from the frame's center, and applies blur to all except the most central face.
